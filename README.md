# A-Topological-Framework-for-Identifying-Structural-Breaks-in-Cross-Asset-Cryptocurrency-N
The cryptocurrency market is characterized by pronounced volatility and structural fragility, yet traditional risk indicators (such as price volatility and market indices) primarily capture changes at the price level and often fail to effectively detect deeper structural breaks in the market. To address this limitation, this study proposes a TDA–based framework for detecting structural state transitions by tracking the topological evolution of cross-asset similarity networks and identifying latent sources of structural risk. We compute Wasserstein distance and DTW distance for cryptocurrency time series within a sliding window strategy, construct Vietoris–Rips complexes on the resulting similarity networks, and extract topological features including Betti-0, Betti-1, and persistent entropy. These indicators are aligned with realized market events between 2020 and 2025, using data from the ten largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, and are systematically benchmarked through ROC–AUC analysis and multiple structural break detection procedures (PELT, BinSeg and CUSUM). Empirical results show that TDA-based indicators exhibit robust performance in event identification: topological connectivity features (Betti-0) achieve AUC values in the range of 0.632-0.650, significantly outperforming Fear\&Greed index, BTC volatility, S\&P 500, the VIX index. 
Across all three structural break detection algorithms, topological indicators consistently achieve the highest F1-scores, outperforming both traditional market indicators and BTC volatility measures in identifying structural breaks.
Overall, the findings indicate that topology-based measures of structural risk provide an important complementary perspective for structural break detection in cryptocurrency markets and has practical implications for portfolio risk management and systemic stability assessment.
